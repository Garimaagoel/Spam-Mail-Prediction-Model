# Spam Filtering Model

This project implements a machine learning model for spam filtering. The model uses a logistic regression algorithm to classify incoming messages as either spam or not spam (ham). It is built using the scikit-learn library in Python.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of text messages. The dataset consists of a collection of messages, where each message is labeled as either spam or ham. The dataset used in this project is [provide details or link to the dataset used].

## Features

Textual features are extracted from the messages using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique. This method represents each message as a feature vector based on the importance of each word in the message. The TF-IDF values of the words in the messages are calculated to create the feature vectors.

## Model Training

The logistic regression algorithm is trained on the preprocessed dataset using the TF-IDF feature vectors. The training process involves fitting the model to the training data and optimizing the model parameters to achieve the best classification performance. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to evaluate and fine-tune the model.

## Model Evaluation

The trained spam filtering model is evaluated using a separate test dataset. The model's performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify spam and ham messages.

## Usage

To use the spam filtering model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your own dataset or use the provided dataset for training and testing.
2. Preprocess the dataset by cleaning and transforming the text messages.
3. Split the dataset into training and test sets.
4. Train the model on the training set using the provided code or your own implementation.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set by running the evaluation script.
6. Use the trained model to predict spam or ham messages by providing new text data.
